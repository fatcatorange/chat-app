## How to start matching

When a user clicks the "start matching" button, the app initiates a search for another online user who is also waiting to chat. If there are no online users available for chat at that moment, the user's remain in the matching queue, waiting for another user to start matching. Once a match is found, the chat session between the two users is initiated, allowing them to communicate with each other in real-time.

## Leave

If you choose not to chat with your matched person, you can click the "leave" button. This action will return you to the homepage, and your matched person will receive a message informing them that you have left the chat.

### Firebase free plan

Due to the limitations of Firebase's free plan, the app may stop functioning if the usage exceeds the allocated quota.
